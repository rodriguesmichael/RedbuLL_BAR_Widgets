# BAR_Widgets

A set of widgets made by a player who loves Beyond All Reason — and wants to help the community grow!

Welcome to my widget repository for BAR (Beyond All Reason)!
Here you’ll find smart tools, QoL improvements, experiments, and random creations that I build simply because… I truly love this game. ❤️🔥

This repo is 100% hobby, 100% community, and 200% love for BAR.
If something here helps you — awesome!
If you want to improve it — even better!
If you want help creating your own widget or brainstorming ideas — just reach out! 😄

🎮 What’s Inside?

# 🔧 BAR Widgets
A collection of widgets made by a player who loves **Beyond All Reason** — and wants to help the community grow.

Welcome to my personal widget repository for **BAR**!  
This project is purely a hobby, built with passion, curiosity, and the goal of helping other players improve their gameplay experience.

If anything here helps you: awesome.  
If you want to tweak, expand, or break something: even better.  
If you want help creating your own widget or brainstorming ideas — **feel free to contact me!**
